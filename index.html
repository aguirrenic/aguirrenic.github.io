  <h3>OEE Analytics Platform</h3>

  <h4>What is OEE?</h4>  
  <p>
  OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) is the standard metric used to measure manufacturing productivity. 
  In simple terms, it identifies the percentage of manufacturing time that is truly productive. 
  An OEE score of 100% means that only good parts are produced, as fast as possible, with no downtime. 
  In OEE terminology, this represents 100% Quality (only good parts), 100% Performance (as fast as possible), 
  and 100% Availability (no downtime).
  </p>

  <h4>Why is measuring OEE important?</h4>  
  <p>
  Measuring OEE is considered a best practice in industrial environments. Here’s why:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Efficiency Identification:</strong> Helps identify areas where production processes are not reaching optimal efficiency, providing clear visibility into productivity losses.</li>
    <li><strong>Benchmarking and Continuous Improvement:</strong> By tracking OEE over time, companies can set benchmarks and drive continuous improvement initiatives.</li>
    <li><strong>Waste Reduction:</strong> Identifies waste in the form of downtime, speed losses, and quality defects, enabling strategies to improve operational excellence.</li>
    <li><strong>Data-Driven Decision Making:</strong> Through monitoring technologies, OEE can be calculated and tracked, providing measurable insights to support equipment maintenance, process adjustments, and capital investment decisions.</li>
  </ul>
